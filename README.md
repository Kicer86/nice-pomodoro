# nice-pomodoro
A pomodoro that respects your autonomy and doesn't interrupt you.

## How is this different from the other pomodoros?
This tiny program won't start blaring out alarms, take away your input, or automatically switch modes as soon as the timer runs out. It waits for *the user* to tell it that it's starting to take a break or going to work. It stays quietly on the System Tray/Notification Bar/Task Bar, and changes color the closer it gets to the end of the timer (thresholds are configurable). The redder it is, the closer the end of the timer. If it's past the timeout, it will start blinking from red to orange. The user then opens it and clicks the button to tell the app to start counting the next timer. 

## Why?
I was annoyed with every pomodoro software I tried. As a programmer, it's very annoying to be interrupted when I'm "in the zone", and anxiety inducing to have to click the "snooze" button on the ones that offered this. This app will subtly let you know that the time is up, so you can wind down or back up at your own pace.
